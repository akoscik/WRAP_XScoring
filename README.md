# WRAP_XScoring
Repository for creating new cross scoring material

<h4>People:</h4>
<p>This repository is built to update cross scoring material. I (Audra) am the owner of the repository, so I have the most control over the repository. Contributors can edit items in the repository with many restrictions, and collaborators can edit and add items with few restrictions. The repository is public, but collaborators can only join if invited by the owner (Audra).</p>

<h4>How to change files:</h4>
<p>Github is relatively complex. Many online resources are available to help you get started. This website can help you begin with the basics:

That being said, sometimes websites make Github much more complex than needed. For instance, some websites suggest you add materials to your repository by working through Git Bash (which is a program that works similar to a command line). However, if you are a collaborator, dragging and dropping files into the repository works. 

If you want to edit a file, you will likely need to commit changes and then submit a pull request to merge your changes with the previous version. If you want to update a file, you may be able to download it, make changes, and then drag and drop the updated file back into github.

When you make changes to a file, it is useful to add a short note about what you changed in the notes section when committing changes. This helps other collaborators know why certain changes were made.

Another important note is that files will show all previous versions and their notes. This is extremely useful when keeping track of updates and changes.</p>

<h4>Questions:</h4>
<p>Github is a more complex program. If you have any questions, the internet is full of resources. If you are still running into troubles, feel free to email me.</p>
